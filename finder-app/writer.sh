# Accepts the following arguments: 
# the first argument is a full path to a file (including filename) on the filesystem, referred to below as writefile; 
# the second argument is a text string which will be written within this file, referred to below as writestr

# Exits with value 1 error and print statements if any of the arguments above were not specified

# Creates a new file with name and path writefile with content writestr, 
# overwriting any existing file and creating the path if it doesnâ€™t exist. 
# Exits with value 1 and error print statement if the file could not be created.

# Example:
#        writer.sh /tmp/aesd/assignment1/sample.txt ios

# Creates file:
#     /tmp/aesd/assignment1/sample.txt
#             With content:
#             ios
